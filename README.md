# Functional-Light JavaScript

A repo for the Functional-Lite JavaScript course on PluralSight by Kyle Simpson.

## Pure Functions

### Side Affects

Something that occurs indirectly; you call a function and it returns a value but also might alter the state of the program or do something else.

## Composition

## Immutability

`const` does not define an immutable value

```javascript
# const array just means that z can only ever point to the same array

const z = [4,5,6];

z = 10; // not allowed

z[0] = 10; //allowed
```

## Closure

"The most important concept"

## Recursion

## List Transformation (map)

## List Exclusion (filter)

## List Composition (reduce)

## List Iteration (forEach)
